    Returns True if `a` is close in value to `b`. False otherwise

    :param a: one of the values to be tested

    :param b: the other value to be tested

    :param rel_tol=1e-9: The relative tolerance -- the amount of error
                         allowed, relative to the absolute value of the
                         larger input values.

    :param abs_tol=0.0: The minimum absolute tolerance level -- useful
                        for comparisons to zero.

    NOTES:

    -inf, inf and NaN behave similarly to the IEEE 754 Standard. That
    is, NaN is not close to anything, even itself. inf and -inf are
    only close to themselves.

    The function can be used with any type that supports comparison,
    subtraction and multiplication, including Decimal, Fraction, and
    Complex

    Complex values are compared based on their absolute value.

    See PEP-0485 for a detailed description.
